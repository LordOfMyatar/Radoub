  - Copy/paste operations now properly update pointer indices when nodes are duplicated
  - Delete operations correctly update indices for remaining nodes
  - Added pre-save validation to detect and auto-fix index issues
  - Save operation aborts if corruption is detected to prevent data loss

### Added
- Comprehensive test suite with xUnit for parser validation
