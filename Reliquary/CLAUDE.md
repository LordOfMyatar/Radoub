# CLAUDE.md - Reliquary

Tool-specific guidance for Claude Code sessions working on Reliquary (PlaceableEditor namespace).

**Read the repository-level [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) first** for shared conventions.

- **Design Spec**: `NonPublic/PlaceableEditor/2026-05-28-reliquary-design.md`
- **Epic**: [#2289](https://github.com/LordOfMyatar/Radoub/issues/2289)

## Status

**Epic #2289 complete** — all 7 sprints landed; shipped as v0.1.0-alpha. Full editor wired (IdentityCombat, Behavior, Text, Inventory), undo/redo, browser metadata, cross-tool dispatch, FlaUI coverage.

| Sprint | Scope | State |
|--------|-------|-------|
| 4 | Project + services + browser panel + fixtures + Trebuchet registration | Done (#2349) |
| 5 | IdentityCombat + Behavior panels wired with UndoRedoManager | Done (#2352) |
| 6 | Text + Inventory panels, item palette caching, BrowserSaveNotifier | Done (#2358) |
| 7 | Cross-tool dispatch (Conversation → Parley), FlaUI smoke, v0.1.0-alpha release | Done (#2364) |

### Open follow-ups (post-epic audit 2026-06-06)

- #2367 — New Placeable flow (`File → New`; currently only Save-As-copy)
- #2368 — Recent Files / MRU (persist + register in Trebuchet)
- #2369 — Dead Save/Load Script Set buttons (wire or remove)
- #2370 — Portrait Browse → shared `PortraitBrowserWindow`
- #2354 — Faction combo from module repute.fac
- #2363 — Inventory column resize / palette gaps / non-resizable window

## UTP File Format

UTP files are GFF-based placeable blueprints. Parser/writer is in `Radoub.Formats/Radoub.Formats/Utp/` (`UtpReader`, `UtpWriter`, `UtpFile`).

### Core Properties
- `LocName` — localized placeable name (note: `LocName`, not UTI's `LocalizedName`)
- `Tag` — placeable tag (max 32 chars)
- `TemplateResRef` — resource reference (max 16 chars)
- `Appearance` — index into placeables.2da
- `HasInventory` / `Useable` / `Static` / `Plot` — behavior flags
- `Conversation` — attached DLG resref
- `ItemList` — inventory contents (PlaceableItem, when HasInventory)

---

## Development

### Build & Run
```bash
dotnet build Reliquary/Reliquary/Reliquary.csproj
dotnet run --project Reliquary/Reliquary/Reliquary.csproj
dotnet test Reliquary/Reliquary.Tests
```

### Patterns
- Follow Relique/Quartermaster: `SettingsService` (tool-local), `RadoubSettings` (shared paths), `ThemeManager`, `UnifiedLogger`.
- **Delete-with-backup is inherited** from `FileBrowserPanelBase` (#2350) — do NOT hand-roll a delete handler. Subscribe to `FileDeleted` for editor cleanup only.
- Browser metadata read goes through `PlaceableBrowserPanel.ReadUtpMetadata` (static, testable seam).

## Commit Conventions
