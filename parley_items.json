builds and runs\n- ✅ macOS ARM64: .app bundle (148MB) - builds (not runtime tested)\n- ✅ Linux x64: Single binary (125MB) - builds (not runtime tested)\n\n### Repository Hygiene\n\n**Workflows Moved** (`Parley/.github/` → `.github/`):\n- `parley-release.yml` - Cross-platform releases\n- `parley-pr-build.yml` - PR build checks\n- `parley-pr-tests.yml` - PR test suite\n- `parley-privacy-check.yml` - Privacy validation\n- All paths updated for `Parley/` subdirectory structure\n\n**GitHub Config Moved**:\n- Issue templates, PR template, labels config\n- Removed phase labels (Avalonia migration complete)\n- Added `parley` label for multi-tool repo\n\n**Documentation Cleanup**:\n- Removed duplicate `CLAUDE_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` (kept `.github/` copy)\n- Removed outdated `MIGRATION_PROGRESS.md` and `_CLEANUP_PLAN.md`\n- Parley-specific docs remain in `Parley/.github/`\n\n**Updated** (`Parley/CHANGELOG.md`):\n- Release date corrected to 2025-11-02\n- Added platform testing status to v0.1.0-alpha\n\n### Testing\n\n**Local Testing:**\n- ✅ All 3 platforms build successfully\n- ✅ Windows binary tested and working\n- ✅ Linux/macOS binaries created (runtime testing needed)\n\n**GitHub Actions:**\n- ✅ Release workflow tested with `v0.2.0-test` tag\n- ✅ All 6 build jobs completed successfully\n- ✅ Release created with all binaries attached\n- ✅ Permissions configured correctly\n\n**Test Release:** v0.1.0-alpha successfully released with all 6 variants\n\n## Impact\n\n**Repository Storage:** ✅ No impact\n- Release assets stored separately from git repo\n- ~400MB per release (well under 2GB/file limit)\n- Binaries never committed to git\n\n**GitHub Actions:** ✅ Works correctly\n- Workflows now trigger from repository root\n- PR checks scoped to Parley/ path changes\n- Release automation tested and functional\n\n**Future Tools:** ✅ Ready\n- Multi-tool structure established\n- New tools can add their own workflows with `toolname-` prefix\n- Label system supports multiple tools\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [x] All workflows in correct location (`.github/workflows/`)\n- [x] Cross-platform builds tested locally\n- [x] Release workflow tested with actual tag\n- [x] Documentation updated (CHANGELOG, labels)\n- [x] Privacy checks pass\n- [x] No breaking changes to existing functionality\n\n---\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>","number":1,"repository":"LordOfMyatar/Radoub","title":"[Radoub] Repository Hygiene & Automated Cross-Platform Releases","type":"PullRequest","url":"https://github.com/LordOfMyatar/Radoub/pull/1"},"id":"PVTI_lAHOAotjYs4BHFCRzggoGQU","repository":"https://github.com/LordOfMyatar/Radoub","status":"Done","title":"[Radoub] Repository Hygiene & Automated Cross-Platform Releases"},{"content":{"body":"Build currently shows 5 nullable reference warnings that should be addressed.\n\n**Affected Files**:\n- FieldIndexTracker.cs: 3 warnings (Range, Purpose, Details properties)\n- ConversationManager.cs: 2 warnings (Null dereference warnings)\n\n**Priority**: Low -

Parley should respect this priority system when loading resources.\n\n## Related Issues from LNS_DLG\n\nThis epic encompasses the following related issues:\n- lns-dlg#50 - Support module override folders for 2DA files\n- lns-dlg#51 - TwoDAService: Priority system for module overrides\n- lns-dlg#52 - CreatureService: Integration with module overrides\n- lns-dlg#53 - Settings UI: Add module override directory config\n- lns-dlg#54 - Testing: Module override folders with custom 2DA\n\n## Components\n\n### 1. **TwoDAService Enhancement**\nImplement resource priority system:\n1. Module override folder (highest priority)\n2. Module resources\n3. Base game data (lowest priority)\n\n### 2. **CreatureService Integration**\n- Load UTC files from module override folders\n- Respect priority hierarchy when loading creature data\n\n### 3. **Settings UI**\nAdd configuration for:\n- Module override directory path\n- Enable/disable override folder support\n- Clear indication of active override paths\n\n### 4. **Testing Framework**\nCreate comprehensive tests for:\n- 2DA file override priority\n- Creature data override scenarios\n- Edge cases (missing files, circular dependencies)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] TwoDAService respects priority order (override → module → base game)\n- [ ] CreatureService loads from override folders\n- [ ] Settings UI allows override path configuration\n- [ ] Automated tests verify override behavior\n- [ ] Documentation updated with override folder usage\n\n## Priority\n\nMedium -
