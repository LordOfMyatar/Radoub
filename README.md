# Radoub

**Neverwinter Nights Modding Toolset**

A collection of cross-platform tools for creating and editing Neverwinter Nights modules. Built with modern technology while respecting the Aurora Engine's legacy.

> *Radoub* (French, "careening") - The process of repairing a ship's hull. Like undead pirates maintaining their vessel for eternal voyages, these tools help keep your NWN modules shipshape for adventures to come.
